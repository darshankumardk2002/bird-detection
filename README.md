# bird-identification
  This a code to identify if the given image is a bird or not. Here we use python fastbook, for installation of fastbook, !pip install fastbook.

# Working of code
The code is organized into the following key sections:

1. Image Search and Collection 🔍
In this section, we search for bird images using an online dataset or search engine.

2. Image Processing 🖼️
After collecting the images, they are downloaded and resized to fit the model's requirements.

3. Data Preparation 📊
A DataBlock is created, and dataloaders are set up to efficiently manage the dataset for training.

4. Model Training 🤖
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is trained on the bird images to learn to distinguish between bird and non-bird images.

5. Image Prediction 🔮
Finally, the trained model is used to predict whether a new image contains a bird or not.
